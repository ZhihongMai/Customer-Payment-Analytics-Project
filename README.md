# 📂 **Customer Payment Analytics**


## 📚 *Introduction*
This project aims to analyze customer spending behaviors and preferences by integrating and cleaning three datasets. We explored the payment amount range for different payment methods (e.g., credit card, debit card) to uncover if customers using credit cards tend to spend higher amounts. Additionally, we tracked payment amounts by payment method over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends, to identify patterns in customer behavior. By aggregating payment amounts on a monthly basis, we provided a comprehensive overview of payment activity, enabling insights that can be used to deliver personalized shopping experiences and ultimately increase revenue.

## 📝 *Summary* 
In conclusion, payment values increased steadily from 2016-09 to 2017-11, stabilized in 2018. Second, Credit cards are the primary payment method, with boleto second, while debit card usage rose from 2018-02 to 2018-08. Weekdays, especially midday, show higher order volumes. Thirdly, The Purchase to Approval stage is efficient, but logistics need improvement to reduce delays. Lastly, Customers prefer installment payments for amounts under 2000, while larger payments are typically made in full. Credit card payments show the widest range, indicating diverse spending behaviors, while most payments are one-time, with slight peaks for 2-3 installments.

## 💡 *Suggestion*
* Improve Credict Card Experiences: Since credit card is the most popular payment type, improving the user experience for credit card payments, like offering rewards or faster checkout may help increase customer loyalty.
  
* Target Marketing Efforts on Weekdays: With higher order volumes from Monday to Thursday, scheduling marketing campaigns and promotions during weekdays may help maximize conversions and drive increased sales.

* Target Midday Promotions: Since peak order volume occurs around midday, offering time-limited promotions or discounts during this period may help boost sales.

* Improve Logistics: The number of days in the Shipping to Delivery stage is lower than Amazon's standard, indicating a need for operational improvements. Optimizing logistics could enhance customer satisfaction and potentially reduce abandonment rates.
